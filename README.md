# Drug Classifier

This project is a GUI-based application for classifying the effectiveness of drugs based on various input features such as molecular weight, solubility, absorption percentage, patient age, and genetic markers. It uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a drug is "Effective," "Partially Effective," or "Ineffective."
